Country Information Database

I created this application utilizing the REST countries API. The user will enter a country name and the application will return information about the country.

How It's Made:
Tech used: HTML, CSS, JavaScrip

I started out with my HTML and CSS and adjusted the layout to have 8 blocks where information would be displayed. Using the REST API, I was able to get a bunch of information about countries and display that information to the user. I used vanilla JS for this project.

Lessons Learned:
No matter what your experience level, being an engineer means continuously learning. Every time you build something you always have those whoa this is awesome or fuck yeah I did it! moments. This is where you should share those moments! Recruiters and interviewers love to see that you're self-aware and passionate about growing.
