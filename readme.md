<b><h1>Country Information Database</h1><b>





I created this application utilizing the REST countries API. The user will enter a country name and the application will return information about the country.




Link to project: https://countryinfodb.netlify.app




How It's Made:
Tech used: HTML, CSS, JavaScript



I started out with my HTML and CSS and adjusted the layout to have 8 blocks where information would be displayed. Using the REST API, I was able to get a bunch of information about countries and display that information to the user. I used vanilla JS for this project.
